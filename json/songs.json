    "comment":"There's a weird, difficult-to-explain quality about this song. It really does carry you, as if floating in a lazy pool.",

    "title":"Die Young - Ke$ha",
    "comment":"This has all the ingredients for a great 'don't pay attention to it' pop classic. Catchy beat, repetitive chorus, and terribly simple lyrics.",
