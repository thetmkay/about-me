        "comment": "If I had to pick one film to represent the entire medium, this is it. Incredibly balanced, high quality, and both mechanically and theatrically well-performed. Plus fun to watch and easy to enjoy - an underrated quality.",

        "title": "Princess Mononoke",
        "comment": "Most of the Ghiblis have the same authentic quality of feeling hand-crafted, but Mononoke-hime also has the inspiring Ashitaka. A \"cartoon\" where every scene and character has weight and depth.",

        "comment": "This movie is just cool. Suave, smooth, charismatic - it's hard to find a mood where Ocean's wouldn't be enjoyable to watch. Sit back, let the actors play their typecasts and enjoy watching the heist.",

        "title": "In Bruges",
        "comment": "Two Irish blokes in Bruges. This movie does and says whatever it wants, yet it feels more grounded than most. A dark comedy; it may not seem funny the first time through, but just wait - you'll get it. It's hilarious.",

        "title": "Love Actually",
        "comment": "Love Actually is the closest thing to Mass I get - I watch it every Xmas season. Cheesy? You say that like it's a bad thing. The pinnacle of Richard Curtis's portfolio - you can skip 99% of romcoms and just watch this one.",

        "comment": "Even if this movie was terrible, it would make it for the Hall & Oates scene. Luckily it's brilliant. A film that makes the most of being 'movie': great soundtrack pairing and uniquely fresh editing that leads to fantastic story-telling.",

        "comment": "Low key films about two people in foreign cities is an underrated genre. Does it get bonus points for being personally relatable? Yes, but Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson still play it out perfectly.",
